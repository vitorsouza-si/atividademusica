Spoonman
Soundgarden

Feel the rhythm with your hands
(Steal the rhythm while you can)
Spoonman

Speak the rhythm on you own
(Speak the rhythm all alone)
Spoonman

Spoonman, come together with your hands
Save me, I'm together with your plan
Save me, save

All my friends are indians
(All my friends are brown and red)
Spoonman

All my friends are skeletons
(They beat the rhythm with their bones)
Spoonman

Spoonman, come together with your hands
Save me, I'm together with your plan
Save me, save

Save me, save me, save
With your

(Come on)
With your hands
With your hands

Come on

Come on while I get off
Come on while I get off
Come on while I get off
Come on while I get off

Come on while I get off
Come on while I get off
Come on while I get off
Come on while I get off

Spoonman, come together with your hands
Save me, I'm together with your plan
Save me, save

Save me, with your
With your hands

Feel the rhythm with your hands
(Steal the rhythm while you can)
