Kickstand
Soundgarden

Kickstand, you got loose and I threw up
Yeah, kickstand, you got the juice to fill my cup
Mmm, my mother says that it's all right
My mother says that that's the only life

So do it right, do it right
Come stand me up
Come stand me up
Come stand me up

Yeah, kickstand, I got a saddle made of leather
Oh, kickstand, I got the words to come together
I got the urge to ride your trike, yeah
My mother says that that's the only life

So do it right, do it right
Come stand me up
Come stand me up
Come stand me up

Oh, kickstand, you got loose and I threw up
Yeah, kickstand, you got the juice to fill my cup
Mmm, my mother says that it's all right, do it right, do it right
Oh, stand me up, stand me up, stand me up
